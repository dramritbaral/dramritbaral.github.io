Amrit Baral is a Pre-doctoral Research Fellow in epidemiology at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine. His research focuses on exploring the biological, behavioral, and societal effects (cells-to-society approach) of cannabis and psychedelics on human health and diseases. Born and raised in Pokhara, Nepal, and trained as a physician in China, Dr. Baral practiced clinical medicine in Nepal before transitioning to a career in public health and research. 
Currently, Dr. Baral serves as the Data Manager and Lead Biostatistician for the Herbal Heart Study, a National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI)-funded R01 investigation, studying the effects of cannabis and cannabinoids as well as various routes of cannabis administration on sub-clinical cardiovascular risk. Passionate about conceptualizing, designing, and implementing high-quality epidemiological studies, Dr. Baral aims to elucidate the role of alternative and integrative medicine, such as cannabis and psychedelics, in promoting human health and addressing chronic diseases. 

As one of the founding members of Dirghayu Nepal, a non-profit organization based in Nepal, Dr. Baral served voluntarily as the Health Services Coordinator. His role involved organizing free medical camps, conducting public health awareness campaigns, and implementing health promotion initiatives in underserved rural areas of Nepal.
