  <p>In the year 2015, to advocate against the stigma of HIV/AIDS and educate individuals and communities on this disease, I traveled across 16 countries in Asia and across the United States in my bicycle. I visited different communities, educational institutions, international media, and health agencies to raise awareness on HIV/AIDS.</p>
